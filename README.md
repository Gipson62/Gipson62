<h1> Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>



Hello! I'm currently working on my own programming language called [Reg-Lang](https://github.com/RedGear-Studio/Reg-Lang). This project is a personal endeavor to explore the concepts and techniques behind language design, compiler construction, and virtual machines.

Reg-Lang is a statically-typed language with a syntax inspired by Rust and Basic, but with its own unique features and design choices. Some of its goals are to be easy to learn, safe, simple and as performant as possible.

I'm developing Reg-Lang in my free time and as a hobby, so progress may be slow, but I'm passionate about it and committed to making it a reality.

If you're interested in following along or contributing to the project, feel free to contact me on Discord at `Gipson62#8015`, or follow me on Twitter at `Gipson62_8015`.
## Open Source

I'm a big fan of the open source movement and believe that sharing knowledge and collaborating on projects can have a positive impact on the world. Therefore, Reg-Lang is an open source project (under the GPL-3.0 License), and I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions. Thank you for your interest!
