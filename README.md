<h1> Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h1>

Hello! I'm a programming language enthusiast, and I'm currently working on the development of a new virtual machine architecture called SVA. This architecture is being designed specifically to run my own programming language called [Reg-Lang](https://github.com/RedGear-Studio/Reg-Lang).

Reg-Lang is a statically-typed language with a syntax inspired by Rust and Basic, but with its own unique features and design choices. Some of its goals are to be easy to learn, safe, simple, and as performant as possible. SVA will be the virtual machine that runs Reg-Lang programs.

SVA is based on the MIPS architecture, and designed with scalability in mind, meaning  it will support a wide range of features, such as custom syscalls, coprocessors, and low-level assembly code.

I'm developing SVA and Reg-Lang in my free time and as a hobby, so progress may be slow, but I'm passionate about it and committed to making it a reality.

If you're interested in following along or contributing to the project, feel free to contact me on Discord at `Gipson62#8015`, or follow me on Twitter at `Gipson62_8015`.
## Open Source

I'm a big fan of the open source movement and believe that sharing knowledge and collaborating on projects can have a positive impact on the world. Therefore, both SVA and Reg-Lang are open source projects (under the MIT and Beerware License), and I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions. Thank you for your interest!
